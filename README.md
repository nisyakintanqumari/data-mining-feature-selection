# Data Mining - Feature Selection using Correlation Matrix

This project explores feature selection methods using a correlation matrix to improve machine learning model performance in both classification and prediction tasks. It was developed as part of a Master's research thesis at NTUST (National Taiwan University of Science and Technology).
